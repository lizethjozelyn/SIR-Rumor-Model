# SIR-Rumor-Model
 Refining the SIR Rumor in New Media Age Model
Our team analyzed the existing SIR Rumor in New Media model, identifying key weaknesses and limitations. To improve the model, we then addressed a primary weakness by introducing new variables and redefining their interactions. Through data analysis and visualization, we evaluated the impact of these modifications, gaining deeper insights into the modelâ€™s behavior and effectiveness.
